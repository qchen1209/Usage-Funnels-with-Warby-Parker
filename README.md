# Usage-Funnels-with-Warby-Parker
\
Warby Parker is a transformative lifestyle brand which sells eyeglasses and sunglasses.\
In this project, I will use SQL to analyze different Warby Parker’s marketing funnels and calculate conversion rates.

There will be five questions in the survey:\
“What are you looking for?”\
“What’s your fit?”\
“Which shapes do you like?”\
“Which colors do you like?”\
“When was your last eye exam?”

Here are the funnels and the tables that are given:

Quiz Funnel:\
survey

Home Try-On Funnel:\
quiz\
home_try_on\
purchase

Use Quiz Funnel:\
Step 1: Find the number of responses for each question\
Step 2: Calculate the percentage of users who answer each question(divide the number of people completing each step by the number of people completing the previous step)

Use Home Try-On Funnel:\
Step 1: Find out whether or not users who get more pairs to try on at home will be more likely to make a purchase\
Step 2: Calculate overall conversion rates(eg. move from home_try_on to purchase stage)
